/******************* Library Kata ********************/

You can use any language you like; when in doubt choose the SIMPLEST option

I would like following features in my library application

1. Add a new book to the catalog
2. A user can borrow a book
3. A user can return a book
4. Print a list of the books that I borrowed

It is just a simple implementation with in memory repository.  
No proper unit test coverage. No proper error handling.  
Just a single API test [LibraryKataApplicationTests.java](src/test/java/com/example/librarykata/LibraryKataApplicationTests.java)
